# NITD-Attend

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to NITD-Attend, your friendly neighborhood attendance manager! I'm Ayush Aryan Singh (221210026), a Computer Science and Engineering student from the batch of 2026 at NIT Delhi. Let me tell you why I whipped up this little app!

You know how there are tons of attendance apps out there with fancy bells and whistles? Well, they're great, but there's one thing that always bugged me: manually adding every single course. Talk about a snooze fest! 😴 So, I thought, "Why not make an app where you just pick your degree, branch, and semester, and boom! All your courses are right there?" And that's how NITD-Attend was born! Plus, you can tweak subject names or add more if you need. It's got all the basics covered, without any fuss.

## Tech Stack

Now, let's chat about the cool tech behind the scenes:

### React Native
It's like the Swiss Army knife of app development. Write code once, and it works on both Android and iOS. It allows for a single codebase that runs on multiple platforms, making development faster and more efficient. Sweet, right? 🍭

### Expo
Think of it as your app's personal butler. It takes care of all the nitty-gritty setup stuff, so you can focus on making your app awesome! With built-in support for React Native, Expo streamlines the development process by providing tools and services for building, deploying, and quickly iterating on your app. 🎩

### Drizzle ORM
This nifty tool helps us talk to our database in TypeScript. It's like having a translator who makes sure we're all speaking the same language! Drizzle ORM offers a type-safe query builder and lightweight data mapping for TypeScript, ensuring smooth and efficient database operations. 🗣️

### SQLite DB
Our trusty local database. It's like a tiny notebook that lives in your app, so you can access your data even without the internet. No Wi-Fi? No problem! SQLite DB is a reliable and self-contained database engine, making it perfect for mobile applications with its minimal setup and low resource consumption. 📝

### TanStack Query
This data-fetching wizard makes grabbing and caching data a breeze. It's like having a super-organized librarian for your app's data! TanStack Query provides powerful tools for handling server state in React applications, with features like caching, automatic background updates, and synchronization across components. 📚✨

### TypeScript
It's like JavaScript with superpowers. Catches errors before they happen and makes your code cleaner. It's your code's personal trainer! TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static type definitions, improving code quality, and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. 💪

## Conclusion

Now, I won't lie – NITD-Attend isn't winning any beauty pageants. But hey, it's clean, simple, and gets the job done! Who needs flashy when you've got functionality, right? 😉

The coolest part? This app is open-source! 🎉 That means all my NIT Delhi peeps can jump in, add your magic, and make it even better. Together, we can turn this from just an attendance tracker to something epic for our college community. So, whatcha waiting for? Let's code and conquer! 💻🚀
